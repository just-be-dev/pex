## Development

This project uses [Mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) to run scripts and manage dependencies.

If you don't already have mise installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

Once mise is installed, you can run the following command to setup the project:

```bash
mise install
```
